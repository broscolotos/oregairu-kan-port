# oregairu-kan-port
-currently everything is just getting ported from the switch version of the game. All of the art is available, working on audio. Scripts are going to be optional; ideally we'd have them but they aren't really needed since we have the actual game to base stuff on.




Thanks to ISLA for finding how to play *and* convert the audio to something we can actually use.
